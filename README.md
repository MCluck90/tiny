# Tiny

I needed a reason to really try out different programming languages. I'm also
working on learning more about compilers. So now I'm writing compilers and interpreters
for [Tiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_programming_language) in various
programming languages as a way of doing both at the same time. I wrote the first one in
a language I know pretty well (JavaScript) to act as a baseline for the others.

The idea is that whatever language I write the compiler in, that's the language
that the compiler will output.

List of languages:

  1. JavaScript (interpreter and compiler)
  2. Dart (interpreter and compiler)
